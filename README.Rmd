[![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/dobin)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dobin)

The R package **dobin** constructs a set of basis vectors tailored for outlier detection as described in [@dobin]. According to Collins English dictionary, "dob in" is an informal verb meaning to inform against specially to the police. Naming credits goes to Rob Hyndman.  

## Installation
You can install dobin from CRAN:
```{r ins1, eval=FALSE}
 install.packages("dobin")
```

Or you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/sevvandi/dobin)
```{r ins2, eval=FALSE}
 install.packages("devtools")
 devtools::install_github("sevvandi/dobin")
```

## Example

A bimodal distribution in six dimensions, with 5 outliers in the middle.  We consider 805 observations in six dimensions. Of these 805 observations,  800 observations are non-outliers;  400 observations are centred at $(5,0,0,0,0,0)$ and the other 400 centred at $(-5,0,0,0,0,0)$.  The outlier distribution consists of $5$ points with mean $(0,0,0,0,0,0)$ and standard deviations $0.2$ in the first dimension and are similar to other observations in other dimensions.

```{r bimodal}
library("dobin")
library("ggplot2")
set.seed(1)
# A bimodal distribution in six dimensions, with 5 outliers in the middle.
X <- data.frame(
   x1 = c(rnorm(400,mean=5), rnorm(5, mean=0, sd=0.2), rnorm(400, mean=-5)),
   x2 = rnorm(805),
   x3 = rnorm(805),
   x4 = rnorm(805),
   x5 = rnorm(805),
   x6 = rnorm(805)
)
labs <- c(rep("Norm",400), rep("Out",5), rep("Norm",400))
out <- dobin(X)
XX <- cbind.data.frame(out$coords[ ,1:2], as.factor(labs))
colnames(XX) <- c("DC1", "DC2", "labs" )
ggplot(XX, aes(DC1, DC2, color=labs)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()

```

To compare, we perform PCA on the same dataset. The first two principal components are shown in the figure below:

```{r bimodal_pca}
library("dobin")
library("ggplot2")
set.seed(1)
# A bimodal distribution in six dimensions, with 5 outliers in the middle.
X <- data.frame(
   x1 = c(rnorm(400,mean=5), rnorm(5, mean=0, sd=0.2), rnorm(400, mean=-5)),
   x2 = rnorm(805),
   x3 = rnorm(805),
   x4 = rnorm(805),
   x5 = rnorm(805),
   x6 = rnorm(805)
)
labs <- c(rep("Norm",400), rep("Out",5), rep("Norm",400))
out <- prcomp(X, scale=TRUE)
XX <- cbind.data.frame(out$x[ ,1:2], as.factor(labs))
colnames(XX) <- c("PC1", "PC2", "labs" )
ggplot(XX, aes(PC1, PC2, color=labs)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()

```
